= Cooler Kreations

Inspired by @visualrinse's Cooler Kreator (http://visualrinse.com/coolerkreator/).  This is not intended to be an accurate port.
It is simply a sample JavaFX application that draws silly little circles and demonstrates FXML, binding to a controller,
using the Timeline for animation, and other simply JavaFX features.
